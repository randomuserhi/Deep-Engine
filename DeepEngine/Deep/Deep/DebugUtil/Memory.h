/*
* It should be noted that this debugger is very crude and fails to compile with placement new
* operations. (In order to do so requires #undef new, such that placement new operations may work as intended).
* As placement new is not an actual memory allocation, after undef simply redefine new using #include "Deep_Debug_Memory_Def.h"
* 
* void* ptr = malloc(sizeof(float));
* #include "Deep_Debug_Memory_Undef.h"
* float* f = new(ptr) float(20.0f);
* #include "Deep_Debug_Memory_Def.h"
* // Continue as normal
* free(ptr);
* 
* Further more, this is not thread safe in the slightest and will spew race conditions everywhere if used 
* across different threads. This is mainly due to how `delete` operator is handled. Other operations like
* writing to the log file and keeping the allocation dictionary can be made thread safe, but the `delete`
* operator cannot.
* 
* Ideally, a tool like valgrind is used as opposed to this.
